cvibe

The npm for prompts — reusable, standardized, MCP-native.

Cvibe - is a lightweight, open hub where you can publish, discover, and reuse AI prompts without reinventing the wheel. No more scattered Google Docs, screenshots, or one-off hacks. Every prompt is versioned, standardized, and MCP-native, so you can drop it straight into your workflow (Cursor, ClaudeCode, Windsurf, VSCode AI). and trust it’ll just work. It’s built by and for developers, creating a shared ecosystem where the best prompts aren’t hidden—they’re standardized, reusable, and evolving with the community.
